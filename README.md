## Description

`R package` and [research
compendium](https://ieco-lab.github.io/slfrsk/index.html) for a *Lycorma
delicatula* paninvasion risk assessment.

-   *Why slfrsk?* slf == spotted lanternfly == *Lycorma delicatula* +
    rsk == risk
-   *Why slf?* Its impact to grape production [is comparable to
    grapevine
    phylloxera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_French_Wine_Blight).
-   *Why grape impact?* SLF impacts &gt; 100 plant species, but it
    prefers grape.
