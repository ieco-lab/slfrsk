## Description

`R package` and [research compendium](https://ieco-lab.github.io/slfrsk/index.html) for a *Lycorma delicatula* paninvasion risk assessment. 

* *Why slfrsk?* slf == spotted lanternfly == *Lycorma delicatula* +  rsk == risk
* *Why slf?* Its impact to grape production [is comparable to grapevine phylloxera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_French_Wine_Blight).
* *Why grape impact?* SLF impacts > 100 plant species, but it prefers grape.
