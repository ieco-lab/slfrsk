	abstract = {Lycorma delicatula (White) was recently introduced in Korea, acting as a grape insect pest. Since the introduction of this invasive insect, it initially spread rapidly throughout central and southern Korea, and is now distributed throughout the mainland. Here we developed new mitochondrial markers from NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 regions, and analyzed the regional isolates of L. delicatula collected from original locations in China, as well as invasive locations in Korea and Japan. All Korean and Japanese isolates were found to be genetically identical to those from Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai, China. Further isolates, from Zhejiang province, China, had two additional haplotypes.},
