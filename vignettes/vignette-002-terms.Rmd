Terms Used in the Spotted Lanternfly Paninvasion Severity Research Compendium

***

# Purpose

This page briefly defines commonly used terms in the **Research Compendium** for quick reference.

# Definitions

- **alignment correlation**---multivariate relationship among invasion potentials.

\newline

- **establishment potential**---likelihood of a region to contain suitable habitat for transported individuals of a non-native species to form a spreading population.

\newline

- **impact potential**---likelihood of a region to experience negative economic effects from an established non-native species.

\newline

- **invasion potentials**---likelihoods of a species to move through stages in an invasion process across regions (@blackburn_proposed_2011). We focus on the main stages: transport, establishment, impact.

\newline

-	**MaxEnt**---abbreviation for maximum entropy, a presence-only SDM methodology that uses machine-learning to estimate the probability distribution of maximum entropy based on environmental variables and species occurrence records (@phillips_maximum_2006, @phillips_opening_2017).

\newline

- **paninvasion**---invasion of a species at the global scale that disturbs a global economic market.

\newline

-	**paninvasion risk**---the likelihood of a regional invasive species to become a globally invasive species and cause economic repercussions.

\newline

- **paninvasive species**---globally invasive species that goes through the three main invasion stages and thus can disturb global economic markets.

\newline

- **phylloxera**---*Daktulosphaira vitifoliae* is grapevine root pest native to North America that was responsible for the Great Wine Blight of the late 1800s, which was the largest economic disturbance to the global wine market ever recorded. The disruption was mitigated by widespread planting of European vines that were grafted to North American grapevine root stocks. The paninvasion of phylloxera continues to this day (@ordish_great_1972, @gale_dying_2011).

\newline

-	**species distribution model (SDM)**---spatial model used to predict the environmental niche, habitat suitability, and establishment potential of a species.

\newline

- **spotted lanternfly (SLF)**---*Lycorma delicatula* is a planthopper native to China, Vietnam, and India. It invaded South Korea and Japan in the early 2000's and the northeastern US ca. 2014. It is known to feed on $>100$ different host species, including grapes (@urban_perspective_2020, @barringer_worldwide_2020).

\newline

- **transport potential**---likelihood of a region to have an introduction of a non-native species.

\newline

- **tree of heaven (TOH)**---*Ailanthus altissima* is a paninvasive deciduous tree that is native to China, Taiwan, and northern Korea, but has been spread globally. It is a highly preferred host for SLF and may determine SLF establishment potential.
